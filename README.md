# Conversion Counter

Conversion Counter is an application designed to record and analyze a sales performance metric known 
as **conversion**. A conversion is recorded when a customer with a Genius Bar appointment completes 
a purchase as a result of that interaction.

## Input Page

The Input Page allows users to enter conversion-related data. Users can select a date using a date 
picker and specify whether they are recording a conversion or the total number of appointments handled 
on that day. The conversion category can then be selected from four available options, followed by 
entering the specific item associated with the conversion. Once complete, the data can be submitted 
for tracking.

## Statistics Page

The Statistics Page displays all recorded conversions for a selected date, including the conversion 
type and associated item. The page defaults to the current date, but users may navigate to any available 
date. If conversion data exists, an edit option is available to remove entries. The page also summarizes 
the total number of appointments and the calculated conversion percentage for the selected date.

## Graphical Page

The Graphical Page visualizes conversion performance over a selected time range, defaulting to a one-week 
period. It displays the conversion percentage for each date within the range and supports multiple 
visualization formats, including bar graphs, line graphs, and plot graphs.
